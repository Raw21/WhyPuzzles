    I'm going to try to keep this brief, so I'd appreciate it if you read this licence agreement in full
    
    By purchasing the Jigsaw Puzzle Prefab Creator Package from Stone Baked Games you agree to the following


    
    What you *can* do with this package:

    1) You can import this package into any Unity project and use it to create jigsaw puzzle prefabs 
    
    2) You can use those prefabs (and associated assets that get created during the process) in any game that you create

    3) You can publish builds of those games for public consumption, either paid or for free

    4) You can modify the code of this package for your own purposes to add additional features as you see fit
        (although be careful when you do this as any changes you make would get overwritted if this package 
        gets updated and you reimport it into your project, so take a separate copy first!)

    

    What you *can't* do with this package:

    1) You can not redistribute this package or any of its code or assets to anyone else (they would have to purchase their own copy)

    2) If you have modified the code in any way you cannot then redistribute that modified code to anyone else

    3) You cannot resell this package in its original or modified form via any platform or claim it as your own work


    
    What you *must* do when publishing games that include jigsaw puzzle prefabs created using this package:

    1) You must include an acknowledgement in the credits that you used this package to help create your game

    2) The wording of the acknowledgement should be along the following lines (it doesn't have to be exactly this but something similar):

        "This game makes use of the Jigsaw Puzzle Prefab Creator tool by Stone Baked Games"

    3) It's not necessary but it would be nice if the acknowledgement also included a link to where the package can be purchased

    4) If you would like the option to exclude any acknowldgement that you used this package in your game, please get in touch 
        with me to discuss purchasing an extended licence (email tim@stonebakedgames.co.uk, or @StoneBakedGames on Twitter)



    Thank you for reading all of the licence agreement, I appreciate it

    All the best

    Tim from Stone Baked Games
