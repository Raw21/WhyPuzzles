v0.12
2022-04-09
* Bug fix to JigsawSvgGenerator to ensure decimal places use dots rather than commas regardless of local culture convention
* Removed some commented out code left over after the initial development phase
* Incorporated the Vector Graphics package directly into the project so that it no longer needs to be added separately as an additional step
* Fixed a bug in the image rotator so that the name of the image is no longer lost after it has been rotated
* Increased the camera size to 4 (from 3.8) to allow slightly more room for the puzzle pieces to scatter into
* Decreased the puzzle piece jitter ratio in PuzzleManager.cs from 0.1 to 0.05 so that the pieces have slightly less spare space between them after scattering
